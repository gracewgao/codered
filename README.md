# codeRED

codeRED is an Android app that allows users to request or provide sanitary products. At some point, we have all been in situations where we forget our period product essentials, not knowing where to get them or being too embarrassed to ask. Through kind strangers, users can anonymously request for a sanitary product (pads, tampons) or painkillers in these situations. This app also helps transgender men who are afraid to ask and the countless homeless individuals experiencing period poverty (the lack of basic female hygiene products).

By filling out a request form in the app, the user can easily ask for a product, and set a time, location, and an optional message for receiving it. This can be done completely anonymously and the user can even request a contactless exchange, such as leaving a tampon under the third stall of a Walmart washroom. Although we want to implement anonymity, we do recognize that safety is incredibly important. If the user chooses to meet up, there is a randomly generated codeword which is used to confirm the identity of the other user. If the person seems potentially dangerous, the user can ignore the codeword and walk away without consequence.

To help others when they are in need, there is a ‘Requests Near You' screen, which displays pending requests sent within the past 30 minutes, and that are within a one-kilometre radius. It is sorted by distance and time, and app notifications are sent to users within 200m, whenever a new request is added. If a user accepts the request, the sender will be notified and the request will be marked as completed!

Along with the providing and requesting of period products, codeRED has a “Learn” page providing educational resources on choosing sanitary products, menstrual health, and how to stay safe while using codeRED - in hopes of empowering women, transmen, and those suffering from homelessness to take control of their own health as well as fostering a supportive community.
